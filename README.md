# Hello 👋 it's me David Nguyen

I am an experienced Software Engineer with a strong background in developing and deploying high-performance, scalable applications, in addition to full stack development and RESTful APIs. I am skilled in multiple programming languages and adept at designing and implementing microservices architectures. I have a proven track record of optimizing databases, automating CI/CD pipelines, and leading cloud migration projects. I am a collaborative team player with a passion for building innovative solutions. I have first started programming and writing code when I was in my junior year of high school, mainly focused on frontend development. My interests lie in building flexible, secure, and responsive applications that will make users satisfied and happy, going beyond frontend development by learning any one or more of the following things such as backend development, game development, cybersecurity, cloud engineering, AI (artificial intelligence) engineering, machine learning, and more.

Here's a glimpse of my diverse skill set:
* Programming Languages: PHP, C, C++, Java, Python, C#, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL
* Front-End: React.js, Next.js, Node.js, React Bootstrap, Material UI, Shadow DOM manipulation, NPM
* Back-End: FastAPI, Google Firebase, Express.js, .NET Framework, .NET Core, MongoDB, RESTful APIs, Spring, Spring Boot
* Testing/Deployment: Jest, JUnit, Unit Testing, CI/CD, Docker, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, CircleCI, Snapshot Testing
* Cloud Platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
